## Description

    In this asignment, we had to build a backend api and link it to a provided frontend note-taking website. We had to create html routes to the html files, and a json file to be used for storing our database data. We used express and path to get, post and delete information from that file using unique ids. In the finished site, a user is able to write and save notes, reference their saved notes that have been stored in our json file, and delete previously written notes.

## User Story

AS A user, I want to be able to write and save notes

I WANT to be able to delete notes I've written before

SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete

## Installation

    From my personal github page, clone the note-taker-hw repository and copy using your local terminal into your files.

## Usage 

    From the deployed heroku url, click on the "Note Title" input field and enter the title of your note, then click on the "Note Text" field and enter the body of your text. You are able to save your note by clicking the save icon in the upper righthand corner of the window. You may display the content of past notes by clicking on their title from the list on the lefthand side of the window, or delete them by clicking the trash icon next to them in that same list. You can clear the input fields by clicking the pencil icon in the upper righthand corner of the window. Your saved notes will be accessible even after refreshing the page.

## Credits

    Thanks to Denis and Joe's Hotrestaurant app and after-class demos. I used their code as inspiration for my own. Thanks also to collaboration with classmates, special shout outs to Evan P. and Cody S. for debugging with me for far longer than they should have been willing to.
